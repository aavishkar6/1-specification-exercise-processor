## Stakeholder Interview

### **Interviewee: Madeleine Berry**

Q: *Are there any factors that disrupt your sleep?*  

A: Outside noise, temperature, high screen time, and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) are the main factors.  

Q: *Do you have any techniques or habits you practice to help you sleep?*   

A: I try to stay off my phone the hour before I go to bed, wear light clothing, or if it's noisy I will put a pillow over my head.  

Q: *If there was a mobile app designed to help people sleep better, what features would you want from it?*   

A: Different types of white noise, something that locks off your phone so you can't use it before bed, a sleep tracker, and an alarm.  

Q: *Is there any app you use currently?* 

A: No.  

Q: *Would you sleep benefit from a sleep tracker or a diary feature in an app?*  

A sleep tracker would probably be helpful.  

Q: *How about a feature showing sleep statistics?*  

A: If it tracked my sleep then yes, that would be helpful.  

Q: *How helpful would you find guided sleep meditations or bedtime stories?*  

A: Guided meditation is good, bedtime stories stimulate my mind so they are not as helpful.  

## Product Vision Statement
