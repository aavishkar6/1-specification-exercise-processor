## Stakeholder Interview

Interviewing **Madeleine Berry** as our stakeholder. 

*Are there any factors that disrupt your sleep?*  

"Outside noise, temperature, high screen time, and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) are the main factors."  

*Do you have any techniques or habits you practice to help you sleep?*   

"I try to stay off my phone the hour before I go to bed, wear light clothing, or if it's noisy I will put a pillow over my head."  

*If there was a mobile app designed to help people sleep better, what features would you want from it?*   

"Different types of white noise, something that locks off your phone so you can't use it before bed, a sleep tracker, and an alarm."  

*Is there any app you use currently?* 

"No."  

*Would you sleep benefit from a sleep tracker or a diary feature in an app?*  

"A sleep tracker would probably be helpful."  

*How about a feature showing sleep statistics?*  

"If it tracked my sleep then yes, that would be helpful."  

*How helpful would you find guided sleep meditations or bedtime stories?*  

"Guided meditation is good, bedtime stories stimulate my mind so they are not as helpful."  

## Product Vision Statement

*Sleepy* aims to help those with insomnia and general sleep deprivation by including calming features.
